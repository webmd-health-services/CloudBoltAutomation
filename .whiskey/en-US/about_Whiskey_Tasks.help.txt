    ## Common Task Properties

    Every Whiskey task has these properties:

    * `OnlyBy`/`ExceptBy`: controls if a task runs if the build was started
      by a developer or a build server. By default, a task always runs. Valid
      values are `Developer` or `BuildServer`.
    * `OnlyDuring`/`ExceptDuring': controls if a task will run in the current
      run mode. Valid values are `Initialize`, `Build`, and `Clean`. Useful
      for having custom initialization tasks, cleaning tasks, etc. Make sure
      the task actually does work in the chosen mode. Some tasks don't have
      anything to clean or initialize, in which case these properties would
      have no affect.
    * `OnlyOnBranch`/`ExceptOnBranch`: controls what branch a task should run
      on. By default, a task runs on every branch. When a build is run by a
      developer, there is no branch information, so tasks that have this
      property will never run by a developer. Wildcards are supported.
    * `OnlyOnPlatform`/`ExceptOnPlatform`: controls the platforms on which the
      task will run. By default, a task runs on all platforms. Supported
      platforms are `Windows`, `Linux`, and `MacOS`. These properties may be 
      set to a list of multiple platforms.
    * `WorkingDirectory`: the directory in which the task should run. By
      default, this is the directory of the whiskey.yml file.
    * `IfExists`/`UnlessExists`: controls if a task runs if/unless an item
      exists. You can use any PowerShell-supported path, e.g. env:ENV_NAME
      for environment variables, hklm:\path\to\key for registry keys, and
      path\to\file for files/directories. Relative paths are file system paths
      and are resolved from the directory of the build's whiskey.yml file or
      the task's working directory (given by its WorkingDirecotry property).
      Uses PowerShell's `Test-Path` cmdlet to determine if the path exists.
      Wildcards are supported.
